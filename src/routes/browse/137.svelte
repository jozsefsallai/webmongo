    <p>
      it's our human nature to pretend, to act<br />
      like we know everything, to feel like no one has ever<br />
      felt before. it's our learned behavior that we<br />
      demand change and try to understand<br />
      things that nobody can comprehend.
    </p>

    <p>
      we try to be unique, we want to share unique<br />
      ideas, solutions, feelings.<br />
      we want them to be appreciated.<br />
      we want people to recognize them and then recognize us.<br />
      as we draw the abstractions of the fruits of our imagination<br />
      we get carried away.<br />
      new goals, new opinions, change.
    </p>

    <p>
      and it's okay.<br />
      things come and go, nothing is truly constant.
    </p>

    <p>
      sometimes we might feel lost. alone. hopeless.<br />
      but this is temporary.
    </p>

    <p>
      we just have to move.<br />
      forward.<br />
      always.
    </p>

    <p>
      let's come together and ask each other questions<br />
      everybody'd ask but nobody can, while the world is falling<br />
      apart behind us.
