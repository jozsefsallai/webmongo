# Tips

- You can switch between dark/light mode using the link at the bottom of the
page.
- **WebMongo** is fully open-source, which means you can always view and
contribute to it. You can find its source code on [GitHub][github].
- You can easily self-host WebMongo on your own server or Node.js-compatible
serverless environments. You can read more about self-hosting
[on this page](./deployment).
- You can install the app as a PWA from Chromium-based browsers both on PC and
mobile devices. This way, WebMongo will feel like a near-native app on your
operating system and will also provide you quicker access to it.
